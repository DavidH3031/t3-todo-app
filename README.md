# David's To-Do Application

## Intro

This app is a over engineered To-Do application made using primarily the T3 Stack which includes: React, Next, NextAuth and Prisma bundled together using Typescript. I decided not to use tRPC which is usually included because Next/NextAuth and Prisma were all new to me before this project.

## Tech

As above this app uses:

- ReactJS 18.2.0
- NextJS 13.1.2
- NextAuth 4.18.8
- Prisma 4.9.0 with PostgreSQL
- Typescript
